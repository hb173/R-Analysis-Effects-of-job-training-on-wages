# Project 1: Effects of Job Training on Wages

## Part I
Conducted a statistical analysis on the effect that job training for disatvantaged workers has on employee's wages using a linear regression model. We regress the difference in earning pre and post training on subject's characteristics. We employ a stepwise regression process to build a parsimonious model to answer the inferential questions of interest. The detailed analysis is available in `Reports/Team-Project-I-Report.pdf`

## Part II
To further scrutinize the relationship between job training and worker's wages, we employ a logist regression model to model the likelihood of receiving a non-zero salary after having received job training. The detailed analysis is available in `Reports/Team-Project-I-Report.pdf`
